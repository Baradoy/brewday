# BrewDay
Temperature measurement and controll for brewing.

Brewdays are great fun especially when the brew turns out well. I wanted to have insight and controll around my mash and fermentation temperatures. I have built plenty of dashboards in the past, why not build one to help me brew?

# Equipment

Sensors are built with [Adafruit Feather HUZZAH ESP8266](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821)s with [High Temp Waterproof DS18B20 Digital Temperature Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3846)s.
The docker setup is running off of A Raspberry Pi 4b with Raspbian installed on an external drive.
